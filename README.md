# XR Mechanics Toolkit

Welcome to XR Mechanics Toolkit, your go-to repository for commonly used XR mechanics based on Unity's XR Interaction Toolkit. This repository is designed to be a practical resource for both beginners looking to learn about XR mechanics, as well as seasoned XR developers who want to quickly incorporate tried-and-tested XR mechanics into their games. 

## Overview

This repository contains numerous XR mechanics, each structured and implemented in a simple, understandable manner. It can be used to learn, study, and adapt these mechanics for your own XR experiences, whether they be games, simulations, or educational tools.

## Mechanics Included

The mechanics in this repository span a wide range of commonly used XR functions, such as:

- [Archery](https://github.com/jackyangzzh/XR-Mechanics-Toolkit/tree/main/Assets/Archery)
- [SuperHot](https://github.com/jackyangzzh/XR-Mechanics-Toolkit/tree/main/Assets/Superhot)
- More coming!

Each mechanic is hosted in a separate folder for better understanding and easier integration.

## Prerequisites
